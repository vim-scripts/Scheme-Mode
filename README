" This is a simple fileplugin supposed to help you write Scheme code fast.
" Comes with shortcuts for usual patterns such as `if`, `cond`, `case`, as
" well as `let`s (normal, letrec and named let), `syntax-rules`, and eventually
" a header generator and shortcuts to inser (print) lilke statements.
" Since many of those patterns have placeholders for code, `f and `s tags are
" mapped to what can be thought of as 1st place and 2nd place. For example, in
" an `if`, first place is the #t branch, and second place is the #f branch
"
" Little help with motions is given too. Mapped <C-l> and <C-h> to the next and
" previous Sexp, in depth parsing order.
"
" You are more than suggested to define the bindings as you want them.
" I chose <Leader>sX so that the "s" reminds you scheme, though is slows down
" typing quite a bit. Moreover, you might not want a 3 keyed shortcut to start a
" quoted list...
"
" Also comes with a function that closes all open brackets.
